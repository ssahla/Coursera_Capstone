## Project Report
### Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods
 
Simo Sahla


### 1. Introduction
If I were an entrepreneur planning to start a new restaurant in Helsinki, which neighbourhood would be a good choice for location? 

I would naturally want to choose a neighbourhood where there are lots of potential customers. On the other hand, I wouldn't want to pick an area that's already saturated with competing restaurants. In other words, I'd want to find a neighborhood with a low restaurants-to-citizens ratio.

In this project I'm trying to calculate this ratio for different Helsinki neighborhoods using FourSquare venue data and visualize it in a way that can give insights on business opportunities in different parts of Helsinki.
